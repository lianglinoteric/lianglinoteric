- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lianglinoteric (he/him/his)
- I completed my MS in Biostatistics @ Washington University in St. Louis and my BS in Global Health @ Duke Kunshan University. My past research lied on healthy aging to cancer metabolism. And I am currently a Statistical Data Analyst focusing on Chronic Kidney Diseases based in Nanjing, China.
- I rate myself as a 10/10 family cook while a 0/10 baker. Anyone is welcomed if they could teach me how to smash that ovenðŸ˜­
